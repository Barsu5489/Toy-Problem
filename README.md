**GOALS**

Writing a programe that calculates the grades of the students

Writting a program that detects the speed of the car

Writing a prigrame thatcalculates the net salary ofan indiviual

**CHALLANGE 1; GRADE CALCULATOR**

The programme prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade uuing the if else statement.
Enter the student marks and the program will generate the grade.

Test the code by running node grade.js in terminal
Make sure file is opened in intergrated terminal before running node grade.js

**CHALLANGE 2; SPEED DETECTOR**

The program inputs the speed of the a car. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

Test the code by running node speed.js in terminal
Make sure file is opened in intergrated terminal before running node speed.js

**CHALLANGE 3; NET SALARY CALCULATOR**

A program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary

KRA, NHIF and NSSF values ar provide in th link: https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm Links to an external site.

Test the code by running node salary.js in terminal 
Make sure file is opened in intergrated terminal before running node salary.js
